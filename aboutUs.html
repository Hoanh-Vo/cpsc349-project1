    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
        As a team, we implemented a website showcasing pet 
        photos. We extracted information about the pet photos 
        from the Unsplash dataset (Lite Version) to construct <br>
        our website. The information we extracted consists of 
        the metadata and captions of the pet photos. We used 
        Static Site Generator to create the HTML for the site <br>
        instead of managing 100 photos by hand. Elventy was used
        to turn the data in the directory into a site with one 
        webpage for each photo. This meant that each photo <br> had
        its own individual page. From each HTML file, the 
        front-matter data was used along with Elventy templates.
        The templates were used to create enhanced pages <br> for 
        each picture plus credit and additional information for each 
        photo. We had to validate our markup and enhance the site-wide 
        layout so the site would include the <br> standard page elements. 
        We added an additional feature which avoided repeating the list of 
        100 pictures. Lastly, this project could have not been completed 
        without <br> the
